            <h1>About the Code of Conduct</h1>
            <p>The code of conduct is the part of the Site's <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> that govern
                expectations for how users of the Site will conduct themselves.</p>
        </header>

        <section>
            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>
                For a detailed summary, please see the listings located below on this page, but in summary, the code of
                conduct specifies a few general ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, users must not do anything illegal with the site, either in your jurisdiction or in ours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, users must not hack, disrupt, modify or interfere with the operation of the Site or its Content
                in any way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third, users must not prevent others from utilizing the Site or its Content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fourth, users may undertake any effort to systematically reproduce the content or structure of the Site
                or its data, such as scraping, data mining, etc. It is expected, however, that users will engage in
                limited reproduction of content for
                'fair use' purposes, as well as be permitted to reproduce content when specifically noted throughout the
                Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, users must treat one another with courtesy and respect; users found to be abusive towards
                others may be banned or otherwise penalized at the Sites discretion.
            </p>
        </section>
