            <h1>Risks of Investing</h1>
            <p>
                Different classes of investments including but not limited to items such as stocks, bonds, options,
                currencies all involve their own peculiar risks of loss. It is in general, always possible to experience
                loss of principal due to an inability to mitigate all risks.</p>
            <p>
                Some investments use leverage, which will accelerate gains and losses and may induce losses greater than
                that of the principal investment.</p>
            <p>
                Investment in foreign entities involves special risks such as greater volatility due to uncertainty in
                political, economic and currency and accounting issues.

            <h1>Past & Hypothetical Performance</h1>
            <p>
                The past performance of a security or company is not a guarantee or predictor of future investment
                performance. This site contains speculative discussions of future investment performance. These
                speculations are for research purposes only.
            </p>
            <p>
                The performance of a security, company or investment in a backtest or other simulation is hypothetical.
                These are not actual records of trades that were completed, they are estimations of what could have
                happened if one had behaved accordingly. As noted above, historical performance is not always a reliable
                indicator of future performance and the same must be said about hypothetical performance as well.
